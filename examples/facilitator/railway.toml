# 
# Uses Docker for reliable deployment with all dependencies
# 
# IMPORTANT: In Railway Dashboard, ensure:
# 1. "Root Directory" is set to "/" (project root)
# 2. Enable "Clone Submodules" in Source → Git Configuration
#    If this option is not available, the Dockerfile will automatically
#    clone the x402 repository during build
