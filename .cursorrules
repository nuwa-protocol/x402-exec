# Cursor AI Rules for x402-exec

## CRITICAL: Git Workflow Rules (READ FIRST)

Before making ANY code changes or commits, you MUST:
1. Read `.github/WORKFLOW.md` for complete workflow rules
2. Check current branch with `git branch --show-current`
3. Follow these rules:

### Branch Rules
- If on `main` branch: CREATE a new branch first (git checkout -b feature/name)
- If on non-main branch: You can commit, but DO NOT push without review
- NEVER commit directly to main
- NEVER push without explicit user approval

### Review Process
- Always show changes to user before committing
- Always ask for review before pushing
- Wait for explicit "yes" or "approved" before pushing

## Code Standards

- Use TypeScript for all JavaScript code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write clear commit messages following conventional commits
- Add tests for new features when applicable

## Documentation

- Update relevant documentation when changing features
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document complex logic with comments

## Before Every Git Operation

1. Check: `git branch --show-current`
2. If main → Stop and create new branch
3. If feature branch → Commit OK, but ask before push
4. Always inform user about git operations
