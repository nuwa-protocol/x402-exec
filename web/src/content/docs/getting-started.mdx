## Overview

x402‑exec enables atomic pay‑and‑execute workflows: users sign an EIP‑3009 authorization that is
consumed by either a standard transfer or the `SettlementRouter`, which then executes a Hook (your
business logic). The showcase implements three end‑to‑end examples on Base Sepolia:

- **Referral Split** — split a single payment across multiple recipients.
- **Random NFT Mint** — mint an NFT to the payer then send the merchant their proceeds.
- **Loyalty Points** — distribute reward tokens to the payer while also paying the merchant.

You can find the walkthrough for all flows in
[`examples/showcase/README.md`](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/x402-exec/blob/main/examples/showcase/README.md).

## Documentation Structure

These docs are intentionally pragmatic:

1. **Getting Started** (you are here) — repo tour and mental model.
2. **Guides** — client, server, and contract deep dives for the showcase flows.
3. **References** — settlement router parameters, facilitator contract surface, and reusable snippets.

Each MDX file lives in `src/content/docs` and exposes metadata via frontmatter. The sidebar order is
driven by `navGroup` and `navOrder`, so you can add new pages without changing any React components.

## MDX Frontmatter

Every doc page supports the following metadata:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | Display name shown above the article. |
| `description` | string | Short lead text rendered below the title. |
| `navGroup` | string | Group heading in the sidebar. |
| `navOrder` | number | Sort order for both the sidebar group and the page. |
| `status` | `alpha \| beta \| stable` | Renders a status pill next to the title and sidebar entry. |
| `hideFromSidebar` | boolean | Omits the page from navigation (useful for drafts or landing pages). |

Feel free to add fields — they are passed through the loader and available to the MDX body via
`frontmatter`.
